/**
 * @file audio-worklet.js
 * @description Audio-thread half of audio-input.js. Passes the microphone
 * through to the recogniser's track, and on the way:
 *
 *  - can hold the output (silence to the recogniser, real audio queued) and
 *    later release the queue;
 *  - catches up on what the queue costs in latency: plays it at SPEEDUP
 *    (WSOLA, pitch kept) and skips quiet stretches. Skipping alone is not
 *    enough — a speaker who never pauses leaves nothing to skip, and every
 *    session switch then adds another 0.5–0.8s for good (ported from the hamham
 *    extension, where 3 minutes of non-stop talk drifted from 0.23s to 1.89s
 *    behind with skipping only, and stayed at 0.13–0.21s with the speed-up);
 *  - detects pauses in what the recogniser is hearing, so speech.js can end a
 *    session where nobody is talking — judged on a denoised copy, so music in
 *    the background does not read as talking (see Denoiser).
 *
 * Pauses are detected on the output, not the microphone. The two differ by
 * whatever is still queued, and a pause in the room while the recogniser is
 * a second behind is, to the recogniser, the middle of a word: ending the
 * session there cut words in half (live stream test, 2026-09-28).
 *
 * Runs per 128-frame block on the audio thread, so none of it depends on
 * main-thread timers.

/* ---- denoised level, for the pause detector only ----

   With background music the room never goes quiet: on a laptop microphone
   with BGM playing, speech measured only 2–3dB above the music, against the
   12dB a pause needs, and every session ran to the 20s cap. RNNoise strips
   the music from a copy of the signal and the level is read off that copy.
   What the recogniser hears is untouched — denoising tends to cost a robust
   recogniser accuracy rather than gain it, which is why the browser's own
   processing is off too (see audio-input.js).

   RNNoise (Xiph, BSD-3; wasm build by Jitsi, Apache-2.0 — js/vendor/) works
   on 10ms frames at 48kHz, in 16-bit sample scale. Other rates (Edge runs at
   16kHz) are interpolated up: the detector needs a level, not fidelity. The
   wasm is the bare emscripten build — its two imports are the heap-growth and
   big-memcpy helpers, and its exports are minified (names per the emscripten
   glue shipped with it). */
